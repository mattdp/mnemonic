Mnemonic started as a way to remember friends' birthdays without using Facebook, and expanded beyond that to a personal CRM. I like it better than [Highrise CRM](https://highrisehq.com/) for the flows around:
- easy data entry for multiperson events
- bcc'ing Mnemonic on my email, and turning a Mnemonic-unknown email address into a new person, an email of an existing person, or a blacklisting of that address
- detailed tagging of people's skills/interests (wants to learn unicycling vs. skilled unicyclist, for example)

Currently, it has no tests/way of deploying from scratch easily. If people seem interested in using it themselves, I'll put some time into these things.

*Conventions*

- Used 1900 for the birthdays of anyone I don't know the birthday of.
