NEXT
harvest birthdays from all the facebook people

v? tags
  [] for a given tag 
    [] have a page on the site
    [] show all people tagged with it and their emails
    [] have a copyable list at the top for all the emails with commas
add information about what people want and what people are looking for
store notes on people
backup data - where does it live? note in README; time machine should take care of it
implement email for fade_action

remove tags
map relationships to each other
enough security to not just run it local - should this be a server only accessible from certain machines or something?
social network connections for harvesting (FB, LI, email?)
offshore worker connections for harvesting

MUCH BROADER
have a roster of personal to-dos and the date to do them (better asana or something?)
