START USING DAY TO DAY

----

consider adding the 1-3 goals/day to this app, would strongly drive usage i think

[] main issue - not using due to
  [] spin up - it's not always just there
    run on a small computer at home all the time, connect to it from laptop?
    vpn - set one up for just this perhaps? is that hard?
    http password?
    regular password?
  [] annoying to add information
    maybe - trying this in a text file
      batch file - one line of each instruction, execute afterwards
      ability to add multiple tags to a person easily, with suggested verb

[] taggings new flow - do with search boxes, not with checkboxes. goal is to learn how to use these, since they make other flows feasible. could half-ass with hidden javascript, but i'd love to duplicate what rails_admin has
  https://shellycloud.com/blog/2013/10/adding-search-and-autocomplete-to-a-rails-app-with-elasticsearch - need elasticsearch running
  https://github.com/crowdint/rails3-jquery-autocomplete - less clear example, don't need a full search engine through
  http://flaviodesousa.com/blog/autocomplete-over-associations-in-rails-4/ - useful secondary example
  http://graffzon.tumblr.com/post/31730804641/lightweight-handmade-solution-for-jquery-autocomplete - useful example


[] can ifttt tie directly into this - like on new friend/LI connection, send http request or email?



backup data - where does it live? note in README; time machine should take care of it for now
implement email for fade_action

map relationships to each other
enough security to not just run it local - should this be a server only accessible from certain machines or something?
social network connections for harvesting (FB, LI, email?)
offshore worker connections for harvesting

MUCH BROADER
have a roster of personal to-dos and the date to do them (better asana or something?)
  ^ this feels like a different project
