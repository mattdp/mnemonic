TRY APPLYING THIS FRAME TO NYE GOALS

3-part frame for affecting change in established habits
  1) "Instruct the rider"
    Give the rational part of the brain clear instructions on what to do to create change. Decision fatigue arises from ambiguity, so not having to struggle with deciding details on how to achieve a goal will help.  
    Investigating & cloning small successes > being intimidiated by complexity of giant problem
  2) "Appeal to elephant"
    Impart visceral motivation to complement the rational reasoning
    Figure out not only how to get psyched orginally but how to bounce back
    Note reluctance to change habits that've been successful in the past. Negative emotions are useful to motivate immediate, specific change, but positive are better for sustained drive towards an outcome.
    Early quick wins are important to motivation
    Decisions aren't just cost benefit - in many situations, based on identity - "what does a person like me do here?"
    Need to hold growth mindset - belief that can improve at anything with effort
  3) "Improve the path"
    Behavior-based goals generally work better than end result goals
    Changing environment (use smaller plates, don't have bad food, etc.) makes change easier
    Building habits is important, since they allow rational action without exhausting self-control
    "Action triggers" help with change - e.g. I will do X once Y occurs
