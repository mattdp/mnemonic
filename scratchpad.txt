to pick a plan for a deed, within constraints:
  have a form with a submit button that picks randomly (probably using a new deed as form_for)
  have a button to that form from the precommit page - one for choose self, one for random
  have the form with selectors for boolean constraints, with proper defaults, wired to nothing
  wire up boolean constraints
  have a slider for minimum times no more than 15 30 60 unlimited
  wire up slider

think about how events/tags should work - when attending an occasion with multiple people, should be able to be attached to one SOMETHING, rather than having many communications with solely one owner. this SOMETHING should then have the option of a date, and if dated should appear on people's feeds.

think about adding select, close relationships between people, like child/husband/mother/gf. dunno how to handle ages. reason: seems like for yen i should be keeping track of her family's names
